# Security in $GAMBIE

## User Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All user data is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
- **Privacy by Design**: We collect only what's necessary, and users can opt-out at any time.

## Blockchain Security

- **Immutable Transactions**: Once recorded on Solana, transactions cannot be altered, providing a secure ledger.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: All contracts are thoroughly audited by third-party security firms before deployment.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all users to enhance account security.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Limits access to sensitive functions based on user roles.

## Secure Coding Practices

- **Regular Security Reviews**: Code is reviewed for vulnerabilities regularly.
- **Use of Secure Libraries**: Only well-maintained, secure libraries are used in our codebase.

## Incident Response

- **Rapid Response Team**: A dedicated team to handle any security breaches or incidents.
- **Transparent Reporting**: Any security incidents will be communicated to users promptly.

## Future Enhancements

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Planned integration for private transactions.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Looking into DID for enhanced user control over identity.
